Index of the ready to use mesh/ folders with their particular attributes.

Substitute them with the mesh/ folder ins simulation_base directory to run the training without the need to run the baseline simulation.

-mesh1:
coarser mesh that allows a faster computation

-mesh2:
mesh with a further refinement of the recirculation region in order to better capture the reward changes during the training

-mesh3:
mesh with a greater control jet width of measure 0.05 instead of 0.02

-mesh4
first mesh we used, the grid is highly refined, it requires long time of computations to run a CFD
